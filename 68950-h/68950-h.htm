<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c008'>The Headquarters Troop were preparing to
leave camp and move towards the East,
where at an Atlantic port they would take ship
and the third step toward saving democracy. Now
the Headquarters Troop are a cavalry organisation,
their particular function being, so far as
the lay mind can grasp it, to form a circle round
the general and keep shells from falling on him.
Not that this close affiliation gives them any right
to friendly relations with that aloof and powerful
personage.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It just gives him a few more to yell at that
can’t yell back,” grumbled the stable sergeant.
He had been made stable sergeant because he
had been a motorcycle racer. By the same process
of careful selection the chief mechanic had once
kept a livery stable.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>The barracks hummed day and night. By day
boxes were packed, containing the military equipment
of horses and men in wartime. By night
tired noncoms pored over pay rolls and lists, and
wrote, between naps on the table, such thrilling
literature as this:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sergeant Gray: fr. D. to Awol. 10 <span class='fss'>A. M.</span>, 6–1–’18.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sergeant Gray: fr. Awol. to arrest, pp. 2. Memo.
Hdq. Camp 6–1–’18 to 6–2–’18.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Which means, interpreted, that Sergeant Gray
was absent without leave from duty at ten <span class='fss'>A. M.</span>
on the first of June, 1918, and that on his return
he was placed under arrest, said arrest lasting
from the first to the second of June.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the last night in camp, at a pine table
in a tiny office cut off from the lower squad room,
Sergeant Gray made the above record against his
own fair name, and sitting back surveyed it grimly.
It was two <span class='fss'>A. M.</span> Across from him the
second mess sergeant was dealing in cans and
pounds and swearing about a missing cleaver.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did you ever think,” reflected Sergeant Gray,
leaning back in his chair and tastefully drawing
a girl’s face on his left thumb-nail, “that the
time would come when you’d be planning bran
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>muffins for the Old Man’s breakfast? What’s a
bran muffin, anyhow?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Horse feed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ever eat one?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No. Stop talking, won’t you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Sergeant Gray leaned back and stretched his
long arms high above his head.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve got to talk,” he observed. “If I don’t
I’ll go to sleep. Lay you two dollars to one I’m
asleep before you are.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go to the devil!” said the second mess sergeant
peevishly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never had breakfast with the Old Man, did
you?” inquired Sergeant Gray, beginning on his
forefinger with another girl’s face.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was no reply to his question. The second
mess sergeant was completely immersed in
beans.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Think the Old Man likes me,” went on Sergeant
Gray meditatively. “It’s about a week now
since he told me I was a disgrace to the uniform.
How’d I know I was going to sneeze in his horse’s
ear just as he was climbing on?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Suffering snakes!” cried the second mess sergeant.
“Go to bed! You’re delirious.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Sergeant Gray put a dimple in the girl’s cheek
and surveyed it critically.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>“Yep. The old boy’s crazy about me,” he
ruminated aloud. “Asked me the other day if I
thought I’d fight the Germans as hard as I fought
work.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Probably be asking you to breakfast,” observed
the second mess sergeant, beginning on a
new sheet. “He’s in the habit of having noncoms
to eat with him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The subtlety of this passed over Sergeant
Gray’s head. He was carefully adding a small
ear to his drawing, an ear which resembled an
interrogation point. But a seed had been dropped
on the fertile soil of his mind. He finished,
yawned again and grinned.</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right,” he said. “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">C’est la guerre</span></i>, as the
old boy says. I’ll lay you two dollars to one I
eat breakfast with him within a month.” His
imagination grew with the thought. “Wait! I’ll
eat bran muffins with him at breakfast within a
month. How’s that?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s simple damn foolishness,” observed the
second mess sergeant. “I’ll take you if you’ll
go to bed and lemme alone.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Lemme,’” observed Sergeant Gray, “is probably
Princeton. In Harvard we——”</p>

<p class='c009'>But the second mess sergeant had picked up
the inkwell and was fingering it purposefully.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>“All right, dear old thing,” said Sergeant Gray.</p>

<p class='c009'>And he rose, stretching his more than six feet
to the uttermost. Then he made his way through
the rows of beds to the sergeant’s corner, and
removing his blouse, his breeches, his shoes and
his puttees was ready for sleep. His last waking
thought was of his wager.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A bran muffin with the Old Man!” he
chuckled. “A bran muffin! A——”</p>

<p class='c009'>Something heavy landed on his chest with a
great thump, and after turning round once or
twice settled itself there for the remainder of the
night. Lying on his back, so as to give his dog
the only possible berth on the tiny bed, Sergeant
Gray, all-American athlete and prime young devil
of the Headquarters Troop, went fast asleep.</p>

<p class='c009'>Reveille the next morning, however, found him
grouchy. He kicked the dog off his legs, to which
the animal had retired, and reaching under his
pillow brought out his whistle. He blew a shrill
blast on it. The lower squad room groaned,
turned over, closed its eyes. He blew again.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Roll out!” he yelled in stentorian tones.
“R-r-roll out, you dirty horsemen!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then he closed his eyes again and went peacefully
to sleep. He dreamed that the general was
carrying a plate of bran muffins to his bedside,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>and behind him was a pretty girl with coffee and
an ear like an interrogation point. He wakened
to find breakfast over and the cook in a bad
temper.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Be a sport, Watt,” he pleaded. “Just a cup
of coffee, anyhow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I fed your dog for you. That’s all you get.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can’t eat the dog.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go on out,” said the cook. “This ain’t the
Waldorf-Astoria. Nor Childs’ neither.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Some day, on the field of honor,” said Sergeant
Gray, “you will lie wounded, Watt. You will
beg for a cup of water, and I shall refuse it,
saying——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Give him something to get rid of him,” the
cook instructed his helper.</p>

<p class='c009'>And Sergeant Gray was fed. As he drank his
coffee he reflected as to his wager of the night
before. It appealed to his sporting instinct but
not to his reason. He had exactly as much chance
to eat a bran muffin with the general as he had
to sign peace terms with the Kaiser.</p>

<p class='c009'>He drank his tepid coffee and surveyed his
finger nails disconsolately. The faces had only
partially disappeared during his morning’s ablution.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>“This is the life, Watt!” he said to the cook.
“Wine, women and song, eh?”</p>

<p class='c009'>But the cook was cutting his finger nails, preparatory
to morning inspection.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now the ink pictures on Sergeant Gray’s finger
nails had a certain significance. They bore, to be
exact, a certain faint resemblance to a young
lady whose photograph was now concealed against
inspection in the sergeant’s condiment can. The
young lady in question had three days before wired
the sergeant to this effect:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Married Bud Palmer yesterday. Please wish
me happiness.”</p>

<p class='c009'>To which, concealing a deep hurt, the sergeant
had replied: “Praying earnestly for you both.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He was, then, womanless. No one loved him.
He was going to war, and no one would mourn
him—except the family, of course. The effect
of the tepid coffee on his empty stomach was
merely to confirm his morning unhappiness. No
one loved him and he had made a fool bet that
by now was all over the troop.</p>

<p class='c009'>At mess he knew what he stood committed to.
“Please pass the bran muffins,” came loudly to his
ears. And scraps of conversation like this:</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you see, dear old thing, I didn’t know
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>your horse was going to stick his head under my
nose when I sneezed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Or:</p>

<p class='c009'>“But, my dear general, the weakness of the
division lies in your staff. Now, if I were doing
it——”</p>

<p class='c009'>By one o’clock in the afternoon the troop were
ready to move. And Sergeant Gray went into
the town. There he tried on a new uniform—and
the story of Sergeant Gray’s new uniform is the
story of the bran muffins.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was really a beautiful uniform. Almost it
took away the sting of that telegram; almost it
obliterated the memory of the wager. It spread
over his broad shoulders and hugged his slim
waist. The breeches were full above and close
below. For the first time he felt every inch a
soldier.</p>

<p class='c009'>He carried the old uniform back to camp and
gave it to the cook.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here, Watt!” he said. “You’ve been grumbling
about clothes. Cut the chevrons off it, and
it’s yours.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, look who’s here!” said Watt admiringly.
“Thought you fellows had to wear issue
stuff.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Laws are for slaves, Watt.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>“Keep it nice,” observed the cook gracelessly.
“You’ll need it for that breakfast with the general.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wait and see,” said Sergeant Gray jauntily,
but with no hope in his heart.</p>

<p class='c009'>The new uniform was the cause of much invidious
comment. Most of it resembled the cook’s.
But Sergeant Gray was busy. To pass inspection
he was obliged to borrow from the neighbouring
beds, left unguarded, certain articles in which he
was deficient, namely: Undershirt, cotton, one;
socks, light wool, pairs, two; underbreeches, cotton,
pairs, one.</p>

<p class='c009'>Thus miscellaneously assembled he passed inspection.
He drew a deep breath, however, when
no notice was taken of the new and forbidden
uniform and when the photograph of Mrs. Bud
Palmer still lay rolled up and undiscovered in
his condiment can.</p>

<p class='c009'>During the afternoon he wandered over to the
depot brigade and left his dog there with a lieutenant
who had promised to look after him. The
sense of depression and impending doom had overtaken
him again. He stopped at the post exchange
and bought a dozen doughnuts, which he
carried with him in a paper bag.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Might feed him one of these now and then,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>he suggested. “He’s going to miss me like the
devil. He’s a nice mutt.” His voice was a trifle
husky.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not fond of bran muffins, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The lieutenant’s voice was impersonal. Sergeant
Gray eyed him suspiciously, but his eyes
were on the dog.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t know. Never tried them,” he said, and
walked off with great dignity.</p>

<p class='c009'>So that was it, eh? It was all over the division
already. Well, he’d show them! He’d——</p>

<p class='c009'>The general, on horseback and followed by his
aids, went by. Sergeant Gray stopped and rigidly
saluted, but the general’s eyes and his mind were
far away. Sergeant Gray looked after him with
bitterness in his heart. Just at that moment he
hated the Army. He hated the general. Most
of all he hated to the depths of his soul those
smug young officers who were the general’s aids-de-camp,
and who ate with him, and swanked in
and out of Headquarters, and ordered horses from
the troop stables whenever they wanted them, and
brought in their muddy automobiles to be cleaned,
and sat with their feet on the general’s desk in
his absence and smoked his cigarettes.</p>

<p class='c009'>However, he cheered somewhat during the evening.
They were ready to move. No more drill
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>on hot and dusty parade grounds. No more long
hikes. No more digging and shoveling and pushing
of wagon trains out of the mud. No more
infantry range, where a chap in the pit waved a
red flag every time dust in a fellow’s eyes caused
a miss, and the men round hissed “Raspberry!”
No more bayonet school, where one jabbed a
bunch of green branches representing the enemy,
and asked breathlessly how it liked it. “War’s
hell, you know, old top,” he had been wont to
say, and had given the bunch another poke for
luck.</p>

<p class='c009'>Before, ahead, loomed the port of embarkation.
The one imminent question of the barracks was—leave.
Were they to have leave or were they not?
To Sergeant Gray the matter was of grave importance.
Leave meant a call on Mrs. Bud Palmer
the faithless, in the new uniform, and the
ceremonious returning to her of the photograph
in the condiment can. Then it meant finding a
nice girl—he was rather vague here—and going
to the theatre and supper afterward, and perhaps
to a roof garden still later.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll show her,” he muttered between his teeth.
But the her was Mrs. Palmer.</p>

<p class='c009'>In their preparations for departure the wager
slipped from the minds of the troop. At two-thirty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>in the morning they went ostensibly on a
hike, in full marching order, which meant extremely
full—for a cavalry troop dismounted
must carry their own equipment and a part that
normally belongs on the horse. Went on a hike,
not to return.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Everything on me but the kitchen stove,”
grumbled Sergeant Gray, and edged gingerly
through the doorway to join the line outside.
With extreme caution, because only the entire
balance of the division and the people in three
near-by towns knew that they were moving, they
made their way to a railway siding and there
entrained.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was dawn when the cars moved out. Sergeant
Gray had secured a window seat, and kept
it in spite of heroic efforts to oust him. All round
was his equipment, packed tight, his saddlebags,
his blanket roll, his rifle and bandoleer, a dozen
oranges in a paper sack, as many doughnuts. Over
and round him, leaning out of his window at
the imminent danger of their lives, were the supply
sergeant, the second mess sergeant, the stable sergeant
and two corporals.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not crowded, are you, general?” asked the
stable sergeant politely.</p>

<p class='c009'>The title stuck. He was general to the entire
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>troop after that: behind his back, to the enlisted
men; to his face and very, very politely, to the
other noncoms.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, go to hell!” they finally tortured out of
him; and they retired, grinning, until some wit
or other would walk down the aisle, salute gravely
and say: “Wish to report that bran muffins are
on the way, sir.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And as the train moved out the car took up
that message of the artillery when a gun is fired.
“On the way!” they yelled. “On the way! Bran
muffin Number One on the way.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Been pretty busy, haven’t you?” he asked
when at last the train had settled down to comparative
quiet and the second mess sergeant was
beside him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not half as busy as you’ll have to be if you’re
going to make good.”</p>

<p class='c009'>However, the troop’s attention, fickle as the
love of the mob, turned at last away from him
and focused on the coloured porter. They insisted
that he was of draft age, and that it was
the custom anyhow to take the train crew to
France with the troops it carried. They suggested
craps, and on his protesting that he had
no money they forced him to turn his pockets
out, at the point of a revolver. And boylike,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>having bullied him until he was pale, they loaded
him with cigarettes, candy, fruit and abuse.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Headquarters Troop had a train of their
own. Up behind the engine was the baggage car,
turned into a kitchen with field ranges set up
and the cooks already at work. Behind was the
long line of tourist sleepers, each with its grinning
but slightly apprehensive porter. And at the rear,
where general officers of importance are always
kept in war, was a Pullman containing the divisional
staff.</p>

<p class='c009'>When breakfast, served from the baggage car,
was being carried down the aisles the train pulled
into a tunnel and stopped. It was a very hot
day, and in through the open windows rolled
black and choking clouds of smoke. The troop
coughed and cursed; but a moment later they burst
into wild whoops of joy. The engine had pulled
on a hundred yards or so, leaving the staff car
in the tunnel.</p>

<p class='c009'>The windows were full of jeering boys, eyes
bent eagerly toward the rear. The end of the
tunnel belched smoke like an iron furnace, and
into it the joyous whoops of the troop penetrated
like the maniacal yells of demons.</p>

<p class='c009'>The general, who had just buttered a bran
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>muffin, looked up and scowled. He took a bite
of the muffin, but he was eating smoke.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What the——” he sputtered. “Get this car
moved on, somebody!” he shouted.</p>

<p class='c009'>The staff sat still and pretended it was not
present.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Woof, woof!” said the general in a furious
cough. “Listen to those—woof, woof!—young
devils! Move this train on, somebody! What
have I got a staff for anyhow?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The train stood still and conversation languished.
There are only two things to be done
when a general is angry: One is to get behind
the furniture and pretend one is not there; the
other is to distract his mind. The general’s ire
growing and the car remaining in the tunnel, an
aide whom the general called Tommy when no
one was near ventured to speak.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Rather an amusing story going round, sir,” he
said. “Woof! One of the sergeants in the Headquarters
Troop has made a wager—woof!—woof,
sir!—sir—that he——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t want to hear anything about the Headquarters
Troop,” snarled the general. “Woof!
Bunch of second-story workers!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The aide subsided. But somewhat later, when
the car had moved on and the general was smoking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>an excellent cigar, the general said: “What was
the wager, Tommy?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I believe, sir, it is to the effect that within a
month this fellow will breakfast with you, sir.
To be exact, will eat a bran muffin with you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The general exhaled a large mouthful of smoke.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">C’est la guerre!</span></i>” he said. He had been studying
French for two weeks. “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">C’est la guerre</span></i>, Tommy.
Queer things happen these days. But I
think it unlikely. Very, very unlikely.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>II</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c008'>Sergeant Gray was extremely contented.
He sat back in his seat and alternately
nibbled doughnuts and puffed at a cigarette. Before
him, stretched as far as the limitations permitted,
were two long and well-breeched legs,
ending in tan shoes listed by the supply sergeant
as “Shoes, field, pair, size 11 EE.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He had surreptitiously taken out Mrs. Bud
Palmer’s photograph and decided that her face
was shallow. And after a moment’s hesitation he
had decided not to waste any part of his precious
leave in returning it. So he had torn it into bits
and thrown it out of the window. Then he had
taken a piece of paper and, writing on it “This
space to let,” had placed it in the condiment can
and put the can back in his saddlebags.</p>

<p class='c009'>The reason of his content was that leave was
now assured. At eleven o’clock that morning the
general’s field secretary had typed on a shaky field
machine that stood on an equally unsteady tripod
the order that at the port of embarkation twenty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>per cent of the men would be allowed each day
some twenty-three and a half hours’ leave.</p>

<p class='c009'>Wild cheers in each car had followed the reading
of the order. Wild cheers and wild plans. Sergeant
Gray dreamed, doughnut in one hand and
cigarette in the other. Twenty-three and a half
hours! A lot could happen in twenty-three and
a half hours. His dreams were general rather
than concrete. Girls, theatres and food comprised
them. No particular girl, no particular theatre,
no particular food. He would call up some of
the fellows from college, and they would have
sisters. And when he had gone to the other side
they would write to him.</p>

<p class='c009'>He had no sentimental affiliations now. He
had put all his eggs in one basket and the basket
had been stolen.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lucky I’m not dependent on eggs for food!”
he mused and, mistaking the hand in which he
held the doughnut, bit vigorously into his cigarette.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nevertheless his spirits grew lower as the day
went on. It had occurred to him that all the
fellows he had counted on for sisters would be
in the Army, like himself. He cut off girls from
his list, on that discovery; but food and theatres
remained. He reflected rather defiantly that he
could have a good time without girls; and then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>considered that a chap who lied to himself was in
the class with a fellow who cheated at solitaire.</p>

<p class='c009'>The day was hot. Kindly women at stations
passed in sandwiches and coffee, and the troop,
with the eternal appetite of twenty-odd, gorged
themselves and cheered in overhanging pyramids
from the windows. The corporals on guard between
the cars slept on seats improvised of saddlebags,
and between naps rolled cigarettes. And the
noncoms in their corner inveigled the porter to a
game of craps, and took from him his week’s accumulation
of tips.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the end of the game Sergeant Gray took out
his money and counted it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Looks like you’d be able to give the Old Man
a right good breakfast,” observed the stable sergeant.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, it’s to be his breakfast,” said Sergeant
Gray recklessly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is, is it?” The stable sergeant regarded him
with admiration. “Want to bet on it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just as you like,” was the cool answer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look here,” said the stable sergeant, aware of
an audience. “I’ll lay you five to one you don’t
breakfast with him at all; ten to one you don’t do
it on his invitation, and”—he hesitated for effect—“twenty
to one you don’t do it within a week.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>“Good!” said Sergeant Gray, and laid some
bills on his knee. “I’d wager I could pull the
Crown Prince’s nose at those odds. Then if I do
breakfast with him within a week on his invitation
you’ll owe me a hundred and seventy-five
dollars.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wish my money was as safe in the bank.”
But the stable sergeant was vaguely uncomfortable.
Those college chaps had a way of putting
things over. He went out on the platform and
stared uneasily at the flying scenery.</p>

<p class='c009'>Sergeant Gray folded his new uniform under
the mattress of his berth that night. It was bad
for the collar, but he did it lest worse befall it.
He suspected the troop of jealous designs on it.
But he could not fold himself away so easily, and
lay diagonally, with two Number Eleven Double
E feet in the aisle. At four in the morning he
wakened, the cause being a dream that he had for
some hours been walking in a puddle and needed
to change his shoes.</p>

<p class='c009'>Still only half awake, he looked at his feet, to
perceive that some wag had neatly blackened them
with shoe polish from the porter’s closet. He immediately
reached under his pillow for his whistle
and blew a shrill blast on it, followed by a stentorian
roar.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>“Roll out, you dirty horsemen! R-r-roll out!”
he yelled.</p>

<p class='c009'>Still half asleep, they roused at the familiar
sounds. Grunting and protesting they sat up.
From the berth over him a corporal swung down
two long bare legs and sat on the edge, yawning.
Then somebody looked at a watch. There would
have been a small riot, but the men were too
sleepy and too relieved. They tumbled back, and
Sergeant Gray lay on his pillow and grinned vindictively.</p>

<p class='c009'>He did not go to sleep at once. He lay there
and thought of his wager, and cursed himself for
a fool. Then he dismissed that and thought of
his twenty-three and a half hours’ leave. If only
there were a girl—a nice girl. He did not want
the sort of girl a fellow picked up in the streets.
He wanted a real girl, the sort a fellow could write
to later on.</p>

<p class='c009'>Little quickenings of romance stirred in his
heart. A pretty girl, preferably small. He liked
them little, with pointed chins. They had a way,
the little girls with pointed chins, of looking up
at a fellow——</p>

<p class='c009'>He wakened at seven. The troop were still
sleeping, but from the baggage car ahead there
floated back an odor of frying bacon, and on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>platform of a station outside—for the train had
stopped—the general was taking an airing.</p>

<p class='c009'>Sergeant Gray blew his whistle. “R-r-roll
out!” he yelled. “R-r-roll out, you blooming sons
of guns!”</p>

<p class='c009'>And, to emphasize his authority, he lifted a
strong and muscular pair of legs and raised the
upper berth, in which the corporal still slept.
Smothered sounds from above convincing him
that his efforts had been successful he dropped the
upper berth with a jerk.</p>

<p class='c009'>“R-r-roll out, up there!” he yelled; and whistle
in hand he lay back to the succulent enjoyment of
an orange.</p>

<p class='c009'>Across from him the stable sergeant had turned
on his back for another nap. Through the curtains,
opened against the heat, Gray could see that
young gentleman’s broad chest rising and falling
slowly. The temptation and destiny were too
strong for him. He bounced an orange on it, only
to see it rebound through the window and to hear
a deafening roar. The stable sergeant sat up, a
hand on his chest and fire in his eyes. He blinked
into the distorted face of the general, outside the
window. The general was holding a hand to his
left ear.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>“Who threw that orange?” demanded the general.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wh-what orange, sir?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t lie to me. It came out of this window.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I was asleep, sir. Something struck me on the
chest. I didn’t see it, sir!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Behind his curtains Sergeant Gray had been
struggling into his trousers. He emerged now,
slightly pale but determined.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I threw it, sir,” he explained. “I had no idea—it
bounced, sir.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The general surveyed him grimly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s a curious thing, sergeant,” he said, “that
when there is any deviltry going on in the Headquarters
Troop I find you at the bottom of it.
Report to me in my car at eight o’clock.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then he stalked away.</p>

<p class='c009'>Down the car a sonorous bass spoke from behind
a curtain: “The commanding general presents
his compliments to Sergeant Gray, and will
Sergeant Gray breakfast with him in his private
car at eight o’clock?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Sergeant Gray dressed hastily. There was the
bitterness of despair in his heart, for he knew
what was coming. He would have no twenty-three
and a half hours’ leave, no theatres, no decent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>food, no girl. And over his head still that
idiotic bet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, hell!” he muttered, and started back.</p>

<p class='c009'>The general was still in a very bad temper, and
his left ear was swollen and purple. He lost no
time in the attack—he believed in striking swiftly
and hard—and he read off, from an excellent
memory, the tale of Sergeant Gray’s various sins
of commission. But he did not go so far as he
meant to go, at that. In the first place, Gray was
an excellent noncom, and in the second place there
was something in the boy’s upstanding figure and
clear if worried eyes that, coupled with another
of the excellent cigars, inclined him to leniency.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But remember this, Gray,” he finished severely,
“I don’t usually meddle with these things.
But I’ve got my eye on you. One more infraction
of discipline, and you’ll lose your stripes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, sir,” said Sergeant Gray.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was intolerably virtuous all that day.</p>

<p class='c009'>Late that afternoon they detrained two miles
from the new camp, and marched along, singing
lustily songs that sound better than they look in
print, and joyously stretching legs too long confined.
It mattered nothing to them that the temporary
camp was untidy and badly drained; that
the general passing in a limousine was reading an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>order that meant an emergency abroad, into which
they were to be thrown at once; that a certain
percentage of them would never come back; and
that a certain other percentage would return,
never again to tramp the open road or to see the
blue sky overhead.</p>

<p class='c009'>But a girl in a little car trailing in the dust behind
the staff cars thought of those things, and
almost ran over the company goat, Eloise, because
of tears.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Darned little idiot!” murmured Sergeant
Gray, and gave his last doughnut to Eloise.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was no thrill, no increase over the regular
seventy-six beats a minute of his heart to tell
him that love had just passed by in a pink hat.</p>

<p class='c009'>Until eighty-thirty that night Sergeant Gray
was obnoxiously virtuous. He had met an English
noncom in the camp, and was studiously endeavouring
to copy that gentleman’s carriage and
dignity. And the attraction of the new surroundings
had turned the attention of the troop from
him and his wager to other things. A discovery,
too, of certain conditions in the barracks distracted
them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A week here,” growled the second mess sergeant,
“and we’ll all have to be dipped.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Might as well get used to it, old son,” said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>Sergeant Gray, and hummed a little ditty to the
effect that “They are wild, simply wild, over
me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>But with the falling of darkness the high spirits
of the crowd broke loose. That night there
was a battle royal in the barracks. The lower
squad room, which housed among others the N.
C. O.’s, decided to raid the two upper squad rooms.
Word of this having been passed up, the upper
squad rooms were prepared. At the top of the
stairs were stationed the fire buckets, filled to the
top, and a pile of coal stolen from the kitchen and
secretly conveyed to the upper floor by means of
baskets, a window and a rope.</p>

<p class='c009'>Twice the lower squad reached the top of the
staircase, amid wild yells and much splashing of
water. The hall and stairs were running small
rivers. Coals, recklessly flung down, were salvaged
like hand grenades by the attacking force
and thrown back again.</p>

<p class='c009'>The noise penetrated to august quarters, and
the sentry at the door, placed there for just such
an emergency, having been infected with the mad
desire to fight, and being at that moment in the
act of climbing the coal rope to attack the enemy
from the rear, an officer with a flash was at the
door before he was seen.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>Followed instantaneous quiet with the only
sound the dripping of water down the stairs. Followed
the silent retreat of the warriors to beds,
into which they crept fully dressed. The officer
moved through the lower squad room. It was extremely
quiet save for an occasional deep-throated
snore. The officer smiled grimly and went away.</p>

<p class='c009'>And in the darkness Sergeant Gray sat up and
felt of his right eye.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the early dawn, hearing the cook stirring, he
went across to the mess hall, a strange figure in
his undergarments, with one eye closed and a
bruise on his forehead as big as an egg. The
cook eyed him angrily, and addressed him without
regard to his dignity as a sergeant.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Some o’ you fellows get busy and bring back
that coal you took last night,” he said. “I got
something else to do.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look here, Watt,” said Sergeant Gray appealingly,
“I’ll get the coal for you all right. But
give me a piece of raw beefsteak, won’t you?
Look at this eye.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pleased to see it,” said the cook with a vindictive
glare.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Forget it, Watt. I’ll get your coal. See here,
I’ve got leave to-morrow, and I want to go to the
city.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>“Well, you can go, for all of me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I want,” said Sergeant Gray plaintively, “to
get my picture taken. I want to send it to my
mother.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Suddenly the cook laughed. He leaned over
the big serving counter and laughed until he was
weak.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Picture!” he said. “My word! She’ll think
the Germans have had you! Say, give me one,
will you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>He went to the refrigerator, however, and
brought out a piece of raw beef.</p>

<p class='c009'>It should have warned Sergeant Gray, lying
sulkily on his cot through that bright spring day,
the beef over his eye and attracting a multitude
of flies, that no one else had suffered visible injury.
The boys came and went blithely, each intent
on his own affairs. United action had cleaned
up the hallway and the stairs. But Sergeant
Gray, picked out as Fate’s victim, lay and dozed
and struck at flies and—waited.</p>

<p class='c009'>By night the swelling had gone, but a deep bluish
shadow encircled the right eye. Frequent consultation
of his shaving mirror told him that he
would have the mark for days, but at least he
could see. That was something. He got up after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>dusk and dressed in the new uniform. Then he
wandered about the camp.</p>

<p class='c009'>He felt very lonely. Most of his intimates
were on leave. Round the camp the men lounged
negligently. Some one with a mandolin was
strumming it, and from the theatre, where a movie
show was going on, came the rattle of clapping
hands. Sergeant Gray hesitated at the door, then
he moved on.</p>

<p class='c009'>What he wanted was some one to talk to, a girl
preferably. He wandered past division headquarters,
where the chief of staff stood inside a
window rolling a cigarette; past the bull pen, surrounded
by its fifteen feet of barbed wire and its
military police.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the edge of the camp he halted. From there
one could see a brilliance reflected in the sky—the
lights of the port of embarkation, ten miles
away.</p>

<p class='c009'>Sergeant Gray sighed and sat down on the road
near an automobile. And somebody spoke to him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can I take you anywhere?” asked the voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was young and feminine. Something that
had been aching in Sergeant Gray’s deep chest
suddenly stopped aching and leaped.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thanks,” he said. “I’m not going anywhere
in particular.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>“I just thought”—explained the voice—“I’m
waiting for the—for a relative and I might as
well be taking people to the street-car line. The
taxis have stopped.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A car leaving the camp threw its lights on her.
She was small and young and had a pointed chin.
Sergeant Gray got up.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s awfully good of you,” he said. “If it
isn’t too much trouble I’ll go to the end of the
line.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Get in,” she said briefly.</p>

<p class='c009'>Sergeant Gray sat back in the little car and
drew a long breath.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s rather small for you, isn’t it?” asked the
girl, throwing in the clutch. “My brother has to
fold up too. He’s in France,” she added. “That’s
why I like to do things for the soldiers here. It’s
like doing something for him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Sergeant Gray pondered this. He considered
it rather an unusual thing for a girl to have
thought of. He considered that she was as nice
as she was pretty. He also considered that she
drove well. Sergeant Gray, who in his leisure
hours practiced running a motorcycle with the side
car in the air, paid her tribute of approval.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll be over soon,” he said with a touch of
pride.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>“You’d better not tell anybody that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why? I rather think our being here tells the
story.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, a lot of people would like to know just
when you’re going. They hang round the men
and offer them rides in cars, and the men get to
talking, and pretty soon they’ve told all they
know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They’d better not try it on me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You almost told me a moment ago.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Sergeant Gray sat quiet and a trifle hurt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am only warning you,” said the girl.
“There are spies simply everywhere. I can’t do
much, and that’s my way of doing something.
That and being a sort of taxi,” she added.</p>

<p class='c009'>They were in a town now, and by the lamps he
saw just how pretty she was.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thanks awfully for warning me,” he said
rather humbly. “A fellow gets to think that all
this spy talk is—just talk.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, it isn’t,” said the girl briefly but with
the air of one who knew.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sergeant eyed her askance.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That sounds as though you knew something.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perhaps I do. Though of course one doesn’t
really know these things. One suspects.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Naturally one does.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>She glanced at him, but his face was grave.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What I would like to know,” he proceeded,
“is what one does when one suspects.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am afraid you are trying to be funny,” she
observed coldly, and brought the car to a standstill.
“Here’s your car line.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He hesitated. Then he made a wild resolve.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I see it,” he said agreeably. “Thanks awfully
for bringing me. We can go back now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She stared at him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are not going anywhere?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, no,” he said, trying not to look conscious.
“I said that I’d like to go to the end of
the car line.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re there.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I only wanted to look at it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very well. Get out and look at it. I don’t
think you’ll find it unusual in any way.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look here,” he said humbly. “I’m awfully
sorry. I was just hungry to talk to some one, and
when you offered——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have done exactly as I offered. You will
please get out!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He got out slowly. He was overcome with
wretchedness and guilt, but her pointed chin was
held high and her face was obstinate.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you very much,” said Sergeant Gray,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>and turning drearily commenced his lonely walk
back to camp.</p>

<p class='c009'>He could hear her behind him backing and
turning in the narrow street. He plodded on,
cursing himself. If he had had any sense and had
got out and let her think he was going somewhere——</p>

<p class='c009'>The lights of the car were close behind him
now. When they were abreast he heard the
grinding of the brakes as it stopped.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t want to be disagreeable,” said the girl,
beside him. “I suppose you did want some one
to talk to. I’ll take you back if you like.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’d better not bother you any more.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Suddenly she laughed. In the light from a
street lamp she had caught her first real glimpse
of his face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wherever did you get that eye?” she demanded.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fighting,” he said shortly. “We had a roughhouse
at the barracks last night.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should think you were going to have enough
trouble soon without getting beaten up like that,”
she said with a touch of severity. “Well, are you
going to get in?”</p>

<p class='c009'>He got in. She had been rather reserved coming
down, but now she was more talkative. His
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>little remark about being hungry for some one to
talk to had struck home. Her brother had said
something like that once. They must get hungry
for girls, nice girls.</p>

<p class='c009'>So now she chattered and she drew from the
tall boy beside her something about himself. It
was not particularly hard to do. Sergeant Gray
opened up like a flower in the sun. He explained,
for instance, that he was to have a commission
when he was twenty-one.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Unless,” he admitted, “I’m in too bad with
the Old Man.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Old Man?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The general,” explained Sergeant Gray, unaware
that the young lady was sitting very
straight. “He’s hell—he’s strong for discipline,
and all that. And—well, every now and then I
slip up on something, and he gets me. It’s always
me he gets,” he finished plaintively and ungrammatically.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you shouldn’t do things that are wrong.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Sergeant Gray pondered this amazing statement.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perhaps you’re right,” he acknowledged. “I
hadn’t thought of that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You might try being terribly well behaved for—well,
for twenty-four hours.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>“Do you want me to?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s entirely a matter of your own good,” she
said rather coldly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll do it!” said Sergeant Gray rashly. “Not
a misstep for twenty-four hours. How’s that?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It sounds well.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The truth is,” confided Sergeant Gray, “I’ve
got to be good. He’s watching. He told me so.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And if you’re not——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Shot against a brick wall probably.” He
grinned cheerfully. “Think of that hanging over
a fellow, and twenty-three and a half hours’ leave
to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hope,” she said in the motherly tone she assumed
now and then, “that you are going to be
awfully careful to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did you ever see a cat crossing a wet gutter?
Well, that’s me to-morrow. This is no time to
take any chances.”</p>

<p class='c009'>At which probably those particular gods that
had Sergeant Gray in their keeping laughed behind
their hands.</p>

<p class='c009'>The girl stopped the car at the camp, and the
plaything of destiny descended.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you, awfully,” observed the said plaything
with a considerable amount of warmth in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>his voice. “I—perhaps I shall not see you
again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I was just thinking—what time does your
leave commence to-morrow?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“At ten-thirty”—hopefully.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I might pick you up then and take you to the
trolley.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Honestly, would you?” he asked delightedly.
“You know, I—really, I can’t tell you how grateful
I would be.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I love to make the taxi men wriggle,” was her
rather unsatisfactory reply. “I’ll be here, then.
Good night.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Sergeant Gray saluted and went away. To all
appearances he was a rather overgrown young man
trudging through the mud of a not too-tidy camp
to a barracks that needed carbolising. Actually
he was a sublimated being favoured of heaven and
floating in a rosy cloud of dreams.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Halt!” said a guard, and threw his rifle to
port arms. “Who’s there?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sergeant of the Headquarters Troop,” said
the superman.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where’s your pass?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The superman presented it, and the guard inspected
it closely—the attitude of the M. P. being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>that all men are Germans unless proved otherwise.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thoroughly satisfactory?” inquired the superman.</p>

<p class='c009'>The M. P. grunted.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sergeant approached him and lowered his
voice confidentially.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tell you something,” he volunteered: “I’m
not the same chap who went out on that pass.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What d’you mean you’re not?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s like this, old son. But first of all let me
ask you something.” He glanced about cautiously.
“Man to man, old son—do you believe in
love at first sight?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Last fellow who tried being funny round
here,” said the guard grimly, “had a chance to
laugh himself to death in the bull pen.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No heart!” sighed the sergeant, moving on,
still on air. “No soul! No imagination! Good
night, my sad and lonely friend. Good night!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He moved on, singing in a very deep bass:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<em>Oh, promise me that some day you and I</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>May take our love te tum, te tum, te tum.</em>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The chief of staff, who had also discovered that
his quarters needed fumigation, raised from an uneasy
pillow and groaned disgustedly.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>“Stop that noise out there!” he bawled through
the window beside him.</p>

<p class='c009'>The superman recognised neither the voice nor
the new quarters of the staff.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Minion,” he said, halting and addressing the
window, “hast never loved?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then he moved on, still in a roseate cloud the
exact shade of a certain pink hat.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<em>That we may take our love and faith renew,</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>And find the hollows where those violets grew-w-w——</em>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>His voice died away, swallowed up in distance
and the night.</p>

<p class='c012'>When he went into the lower squad room a
sort of chant greeted him from the beds: “Where,
oh where’s the sergeant been?”</p>

<p class='c009'>And the reply shouted lustily: “Out getting
measured for a shave.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He undressed quietly, and salvaging the piece
of beefsteak from under his pillow got into bed
and placed it carefully over his eye.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>III</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c008'>But tragedy had marked Sergeant Gray for
its own. At reveille he rolled over, yawned
and without lifting himself reached up to the
pocket of his blouse and retrieved his whistle.</p>

<p class='c009'>He blew it and shouted as usual: “R-r-roll out,
you dirty horsemen! R-r-roll out!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then, arms under his head, he lay and dreamed.
Round the day to come he wove little fantasies
of the new uniform, and money in his pocket, and
twenty-three and a half hours’ leave, and—the girl
in the little car. His pass he had already secured
through the top sergeant. It had been, with others
on the pass list, O.K’d by the captain and re-O.K’d
by the military police. At ten-thirty that
morning Sergeant Gray would be a free man.</p>

<p class='c009'>He made a huge breakfast, and careful inspection
showed the eye greatly improved. And he
whistled blithely while laying out his things for
the official inspection, comparing his belongings
carefully with a list in his hand. Nothing was to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>go wrong that day, nothing mar the perfection of
it or curtail his leave.</p>

<p class='c009'>But he failed to count the camp quartermaster;
and that Destiny, which had taken him in hand
forty-eight hours ago, was making of him her toy.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now camp quartermasters are but human.
They have their good days and their bad, and
sometimes it rather gets on their nerves, the eternal
examining and determining, for instance, that
every man of perhaps thirty thousand possesses
in perfect condition:</p>

<p class='c009'>Sergeant Gray’s Destiny, working by devious
ways, had given the camp inspector a headache, a
bad breakfast, a shirt lost by the laundry and a
wigging by somebody or other. Into the bargain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>it was a fine day for golf and here he was looking
over breeches, O. D. wool, pairs, two; and so on.</p>

<p class='c009'>Into the barracks then came fate in the shape
of the camp inspector, military of figure and militant
of disposition, to count the pins for shelter
halves, for instance, and generally to do anything
but swing a golf club, as his heart desired. The
men lined up by their equipment and the inspector
went down the line. And he opened, by evil
chance, Sergeant Gray’s condiment can and found
the space-to-let notice inside.</p>

<p class='c009'>He looked at it, and then he looked at the tall
sergeant. Now to save all he could of his twenty-three
and a half hours’ leave Sergeant Gray had
put on his new uniform, which was against the
rules. He had obeyed the regulations exactly as
to his hat cord, whistle, collar insignia, buttons
and shoes. Otherwise from his healthy skin to his
putties he wore not a single issue article.</p>

<p class='c009'>The second mess sergeant eying him before inspection
had warned him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ll get into trouble with that outfit,
Gray,” he had said. And Gray had replied that
if he did it would be his trouble.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Possibly,” had been the second mess sergeant’s
comment. “But if you put him in a bad humour
and get him started—there’ll be hell to pay.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>And now there was to be hell to pay. And the
inspector, who might have been expected to walk
in one door and out another but did not, stood off
and surveyed him coldly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Issue uniform?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='c009'>“N-no, sir.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Take it off!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Sergeant Gray obeyed. Once off, the full extent
of his iniquity, as to his undershirt, underbreeches
and socks, was revealed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Scrap the clothing this man is wearing,” ordered
the inspector. And to Sergeant Gray:
“Show me your issue uniforms.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Now the sergeant was hard on clothing, and
particularly on breeches. Also he had given one
uniform to Watt, the cook. The single one he
was able to produce was badly worn; so badly,
indeed, that the camp inspector with his two hands
tore the breeches apart, at a vital spot, and flung
them on the floor. Something in Sergeant Gray’s
breast seemed to tear also and sink to the floor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Scrap this one also,” ordered the camp inspector.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sir——” ventured Sergeant Gray desperately.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the camp inspector had discovered something,
namely: That the issue uniforms of the
Headquarters Troop of the ——th Division were
of poor material. Slowly and carefully he went
through the lot. Sharply and decisively, at the
end, he gave his orders.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>“IF A MAN FROM THE HEADQUARTERS TROOP OVERSTAYS HIS LEAVE, WHAT HAPPENS TO HIM, UNCLE JIMMY?” <span class='right'><em>See page <a href='#Page_76'>76</a></em></span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>“Scrap every uniform in the troop,” he said,
“and send this order to the camp quartermaster.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In ten minutes one hundred and ninety-five men
stood to attention in their undergarments, and in
the center of each squad room lay a great heap of
discarded khaki.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Leaving us rather stripped, sir,” ventured the
captain.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They’ve got their slickers,” curtly observed
fate; “and the quartermaster will fix you up all
right.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He went out. Jove, what a day for golf!</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sergeant!” called the captain.</p>

<p class='c009'>He avoided the baleful eyes of his men and
looked out of a window. He was rather young
and terribly afraid he would laugh.</p>

<p class='c009'>The supply sergeant, thus called, came forward
and saluted. He was a queer figure in his woolens,
and the captain coughed to recover his voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Put—put on your slicker,” he said, “and carry
this order to the camp quartermaster. And
hurry!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Now all the balance of this story rests on that
order to hurry, for it came about that the supply
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>sergeant, running, put his toe under the edge of
a board and fell heavily, and a military policeman,
discovering thus that the sergeant wore no
breeches, placed him immediately under arrest.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, very well,” said the supply sergeant politely;
and put the order in his slicker pocket. If
they chose to arrest a man for a thing he couldn’t
help let them do it. He didn’t absolutely know
what was in the order and if he could sit in the
bull pen the troop could sit in its underwear. It
was nothing whatever to him.</p>

<p class='c009'>He grinned malevolently, however, when he
saw the captain and the two lieutenants of the
troop leaving camp in a machine in the direction
of the city.</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right,” he said to himself. “We’ll see
something later, that’s all. The old boy will be
crazy about this.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The old boy being the general.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the barracks black despair was in Sergeant
Gray’s heart. He made a wild effort to retrieve
his new uniform from the heap which was to be
carried out and burned, but the troop were a unit
against him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Aw, keep still!” they said in effect. “You
got us into this, and you’ll stick it out with us.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>“I’ve got leave, fellows,” he appealed to the
other noncoms. “I’ve got an engagement too.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We know. To breakfast with the general,”
sneered the stable sergeant. “Well, you’d better
send your regrets.”</p>

<p class='c009'>At ten-fifteen the troop, having waited an hour,
were growing uneasy, and Sergeant Gray was stationed
at a window, watching three men in slickers
tending a fire of mammoth proportions. At ten-thirty,
going to a window in one of the two upper
squad rooms, he made out a small car down the
road, and a girl with a pink hat in it. There was
no supply sergeant in sight.</p>

<p class='c009'>At ten forty-five a scout patrol in slickers having
been sent out reported the supply sergeant not
in the camp quartermaster’s office, as observed
through a window, and the troop officers as having
gone for the day.</p>

<p class='c009'>Black despair, then, in a hundred and ninety-five
hearts, but in no one of them such agony as
in Sergeant Gray’s. Clad in an army slicker he
made a dozen abortive attempts to borrow a uniform
from tall men in other companies, but inspection
was on, and had commenced with the
Headquarters Troop. Not a man dared to be
found with less than “breeches, O. D. wool, prs.,
two.” And blouses the same.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>At eleven o’clock with the glare of frenzy in his
eyes Sergeant Gray put on a slicker, put his pass
in his pocket and left the barracks. Outside the
door he hesitated. The sun was gleaming from a
hot sky, and there was no wind. The absence of
wind, he felt, was in his favour. During his hurried
walk toward the little car he was feeling in
his mind for some excuse for the slicker, but he
found himself beside the car before he had found
anything to satisfy him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are late,” said the girl severely.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Awfully busy morning,” he explained. “Inspection
and—er—all that. There’s a lot to get
ready,” he added mysteriously.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was aware of her careful scrutiny, and he
flushed guiltily. As for the girl, she seemed satisfied
with what she saw. He was a gentleman,
clearly. But a slicker!</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’d better take that raincoat back,” she
observed. “You won’t need it. It’s going to be
clear and hot.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I guess I’ll take it, anyhow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ll be checking it somewhere, and then forgetting
to get it again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He was frightfully uneasy. She was the sort
of girl who seemed bent on getting her own way.
So he muttered something about having a cold,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>and she countered with a flat statement that he
would get more if he dressed too warmly.</p>

<p class='c009'>They had reached what amounted to an <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">impasse</span></i>
when a small boy flung a card into the car.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t bother about it,” said the girl as he
stooped to get it. “I have one in my pocket for
you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thanks, awfully,” said the sergeant, rather
surprised. “What is it? A theatre ticket?”</p>

<p class='c009'>She did not reply at once. He saw that they
were passing the end of the trolley line and going
on. He had a little thrill of mingled delight and
uneasiness. He had had no plans particularly,
except to see her again. His only program had
been destroyed in the bonfire.</p>

<p class='c009'>Suddenly she drew the little car up beside the
road.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Have you anything you want particularly to
do to-day?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I was just going to play round.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Would you like to do a real service? A national
service?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I seem to be doing it most of the time,” he
observed with some bitterness.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You said yesterday you were going to have
your picture taken.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Good heavens, was this marvel, this creature
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>from another world, going to ask for his photograph?</p>

<p class='c009'>“I would, but this eye——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“See here,” she said briskly. “I want you to
get your picture taken. I want it for a special
reason. And I want you to go”—she felt in her
pocket and pulled out a card—“I want you to go
to this man.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I see,” he said, and took the card. “Friend
of yours?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certainly not!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Does he take good photographs?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know. You might read the card.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He read it carefully. It merely stated that
J. M. Booth of a certain number on Twenty-Second
Street made excellent photographs very
cheap, filled rush orders for soldiers, and gave
them a special discount. He even turned it over,
but the other side was blank.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t get it, I guess,” he said at last.
“What’s the answer?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The more I see of army men the less imagination
I find,” was her surprising reply. “I took
that card last night to the—to an officer I know;
and he was just like you. I hope you put more
intelligence into your fighting than you do into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>other things. How many soldiers do you suppose
have gone to that man?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I’ll be one, anyhow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He rose gallantly to the occasion.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A good many hundred, probably. As each division
comes in and gets leave they all run to get
their pictures taken, don’t they? And they want
them by a certain time? Why? Because they’re
going to sail, of course.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s no argument on my part.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But suppose that man’s name isn’t Booth?
Suppose I told you he’d once been the court photographer
at Vienna?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Sergeant Gray whistled.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are you telling me that?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am. My dressmaker is in the same building.
She told me. He showed her a lot of photographs
of the royal family.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Every boy has longed at some period of his life
to be a detective. Sergeant Gray suddenly felt
the fine frenzy of the sleuth. But there was disappointment
too.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So that’s why you picked me up last night?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not at all. But it’s why I came for you this
morning.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Would you mind explaining that?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not at all. I picked you up because I carry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>all the boys I can to the street car. But after we
had talked I felt you would understand. Some
of them wouldn’t.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Sergeant Gray at once put on the expression
of one who understood perfectly. But happening
to glance down, the better to reflect, he saw that
the slicker had slid back an inch or so, revealing
that amount of a knee that was not covered with
khaki. He blushed furiously, but the girl’s eyes
were on the road ahead.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do hope you’ll help me out,” she was saying.
“It wouldn’t be of any use for me to go, you
know. But I’ll go with you. I’ll be your sister
if you don’t mind.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was on the tip of his tongue to say that there
were other relationships he would prefer, but he
did not. She was not that sort of a girl. And he
was uneasily aware, too, that her interest in him
was purely academic. Not that he put it that
way, of course.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The one thing you mustn’t do,” she warned
him, “is to tell when you actually sail. I thought
you might say that the submarine trouble has held
up all sailings, and you’re not going for a month.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right,” he agreed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just when do you sail?” she asked suddenly.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was exceedingly troubled. He had no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>finesse, and here was a point-blank question. He
answered it bluntly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sorry. I can’t tell you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re a good boy,” she said with approval.
“I know anyhow, so it doesn’t matter. I just wondered
if you would tell.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You know a lot of things,” was his admiring
comment.</p>

<p class='c009'>Half an hour later he was following the girl
into a dingy elevator. He was suffering the pangs
of bitter disappointment, for on his observing that
if the fellow tried to find out when the division
was sailing he would throw him out of the window
the girl had turned on him sharply.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ll do nothing of the kind,” she said.
“You’ll tell him what we’ve agreed on, and that’s
all.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All?” he had protested. “And let him get
away with it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll decide what to do later,” she had answered
cryptically. And somehow he had felt
that he had fallen in her estimation.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the elevator she said out of a clear sky:
“You’ll have to take that raincoat off, of course.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He swallowed nervously.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sure I will,” he replied. “But—look here,
you don’t mind if I ask you to stay out while I’m
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>being done, do you? I—I’m funny about pictures.
I don’t like any one round. Queer thing,”
he went on desperately, seeing her face. “Always
been like that. I——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I didn’t come here to see you have a photograph
taken,” she replied coldly.</p>

<p class='c009'>For the next half hour he did not see her. He
was extremely busy.</p>

<p class='c009'>J. M. Booth proved to be a slow worker. Sergeant
Gray, who had been recently mixing with
all races in the Army, was quick to see that he
spoke fluent English with a slight burr.</p>

<p class='c009'>“French, aren’t you?” he asked genially while
Mr. Booth shifted the scenery.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Alsatian,” corroborated Mr. Booth. “But this
is my country. I have even taken an American
name. Now if you will remove the raincoat——”</p>

<p class='c009'>Sergeant Gray moved a step nearer to him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can’t,” he explained in a low tone. “Nothing
under it. You’ll have to shoot as I am.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No uniform?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No uniform. What d’you think of a country
that will send fellows to fight like that, eh?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Booth’s small black eyes peered at him
suspiciously.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is it possible?” he demanded. “This great
country, so rich, and—no uniforms.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>“Uniforms!” continued Sergeant Gray, beginning
to enjoy himself hugely. “Why, say, we
haven’t anything! No guns worth the name, not
enough shoes. Why, a fellow in my company’s
wearing two rights at this minute. And as for
uniforms—why, I’ll tell you this—my whole company’s
going round to-day like this, slickers and
nothing else.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Amazing!” commented Mr. Booth unctuously.
“We hear of so much money being spent, and
yet nothing to show for it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Graft!” explained the sergeant in a very deep
bass. “Graft, that’s what it is!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Booth seemed temporarily to forget that
he was there to take a picture.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you—we will come out all right,” he observed,
watching the sergeant closely. “We have
so much. The Browning gun, now—do you know
about that? It is wonderful, not so?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wonderful?” queried the sergeant, feeling
happier than he had for some time. “Well, I’m
a machine gunner; and if we’re to get anywhere
we’ve got to do better than the Browning.” He
had a second’s uneasiness then, until he remembered
that he wore no insignia. “It heats. It
jams. It——” Here ended his knowledge of
machine guns. “It’s rotten, that’s all.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>Mr. Booth was moistening his lips.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s sad news,” he observed. “I—but this
Liberty motor—I understand it’s a success.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’d better not ask me about that,” said the
sergeant gravely. “Ever since my brother went
down——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Went down? Fell?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Aviation. Engine too heavy for the wings.
Got up a hundred feet—first plane, you know,
testing it out. And——”</p>

<p class='c009'>He drew a long breath.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wonder,” said Mr. Booth, “if you would
care for a little drink? I keep some here for the
boys. The city’s a dry place for soldiers. It’ll
cheer you up.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m off liquor.” It was the first truth he had
spoken for some time, and it sounded strange to
his ears. “Rotten food and all that. Can’t drink.
That’s straight.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It had not been lost on him that Mr. Booth was
endeavoring to conceal a vast cheerfulness; also
that his refusal to drink was unexpected.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Better have the picture, old top,” he observed.
“Better get this eye on the off side, hadn’t you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>For some five minutes Mr. Booth alternately
disappeared under a black cloth and reappeared
again. The sergeant felt that under a pretence of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>focusing he was being subjected to a close scrutiny,
and bore himself carefully and well.</p>

<p class='c009'>When at last it was over Mr. Booth put a question.
“Want these in a hurry, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hurry? Why?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Most of the boys are just about to sail. They
come in here and give me two days, three days.
It is not enough.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I can give you a month if you want it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re not going soon, then?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should say not! Do you think Uncle Sam’s
going to trust any transports out with these German
submarines about? I guess not!”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was no question as to Mr. Booth’s excitement
now. His round face fairly twitched.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you cannot know that,” he said. “That
is camp talk, eh?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not on your life!” said the sergeant, and went
closer to him. “I got a cousin in headquarters; and
he saw the order from Washington.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What was the order? You remember it,
eh?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All orders for troops to sail during month of
June canceled,” lied the sergeant glibly. “Not
likely to forget that, old top, with a month to
play round in your dear old town.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He was filled with admiration of himself. And
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>under that admiration was swelling and growing
a great loathing for the creature before him. He
would fill him with lies as full as he would hold.
And then he would get him. But he would consult
the girl about that. She had forbidden violence,
but when she knew the facts——</p>

<p class='c009'>He gave his name and put down a deposit.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are sure you are in no hurry?” asked Mr.
Booth, scrutinising him carefully.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wish I was as sure of a uniform.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The girl was waiting, and together they went
down to the street. Though her eyes were eager
she asked no questions. She preceded Sergeant
Gray to the little car and got in. And suddenly
a chill struck to the sergeant’s heart.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the pavement, eying him with cold and
glittering eyes, were the stable sergeant, the troop
mess sergeant, the second mess sergeant and two
corporals. Like himself they wore slickers to cover
certain deficiencies, and unlike him they wore an
expression of cold and calculating deviltry.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hello!” they said, and surrounded him.
“Having a good time?”</p>

<p class='c009'>He cast an agonised glance at the car. The
girl was looking ahead.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pretty fair,” he replied; and calculated the
distance to the car.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>“We’ve been keeping an eye open for you,”
said the stable sergeant, stepping between him and
the car. “We want to have a word with you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll meet you somewhere.” There was pleading
in his voice. “Anywhere you say, in an hour.”
Their faces were cold and unrelenting. “In a half
hour, then.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What we’ve got to do won’t wait,” observed
the stable sergeant. “How do you think we like
going about like this anyhow? Our only chance
to have a time, and going round like a lot of lunatics.
We warned you, didn’t we? We——”</p>

<p class='c009'>Sergeant Gray knew what was coming. He had
known it with deadly certainty from the moment
he saw that menacing group, cold of eye but hot
of face. And strong as he was he was no match
for five of them, hardened with months of training
and infuriated with outrage.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m with a young lady, fellows,” he pleaded.
“Don’t make a row here. If you’ll only
wait——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, there won’t be any row,” observed the
stable sergeant. “You take off that slicker, that’s
all.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not here! For heaven’s sake, fellows, not on
the street! I tell you I’ve got a girl with me.
A nice girl. A——”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>The stable sergeant hesitated and glanced toward
the car.</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right,” he said. “But we’re going to take
that slicker back to camp. We promised the
troop. You can step inside that door. I guess
that’s satisfactory?”</p>

<p class='c009'>He glanced at the group, which nodded grimly.</p>

<p class='c009'>For an instant Sergeant Gray was tempted to
run and chance it, but the girl had turned her head
and was watching them curiously. Hope died in
him. He could neither run nor fight. And the
group closed in on him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“’Bout face—march!” said the stable sergeant.</p>

<p class='c009'>And he marched.</p>

<p class='c009'>Inside the hallway, behind the elevator, however,
he turned loose with his fists. He fought
desperately, using his long arms with accuracy and
precision. One of the corporals went down first.
The second mess sergeant followed him. But the
result was inevitable. Inside of three minutes the
girl saw the little group returning to the street.
One corporal held a handkerchief to his lip, and
the first mess sergeant was holding together a
slicker which had no longer any clasps. The stable
sergeant, however, was calm and happy. He
carried a slicker over his arm.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>“Sergeant Gray’s compliments, miss,” he said,
saluting. Then, as an afterthought of particular
fiendishness: “And he will be engaged for some
time. If you would take charge of this slicker
he’ll be much obliged to you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He saluted again, and the group swaggered
down the street.</p>

<p class='c009'>The girl sat in the car and looked after them.
Then she glanced at the slicker, and a little frown
gathered between her eyes. Had he, against her
orders, gone back to deal with Mr. Booth alone?
She was mystified and not a little indignant, and
when she started the car again it was with a jerk
of irritation.</p>

<p class='c009'>Inside the hallway, behind the elevator, cursed
and raged Sergeant Gray. At every step in the
doorway he shook with apprehension. Behind
him stretched a wooden staircase, toward which he
cast agonised eyes. The elevator came down, discharged
its passengers, filled again and went up.
Outside in the brilliant street thousands of feet
passed, carrying people fully clothed and entitled
to a place in the sun. Momentarily he expected
the climax of his wretchedness—that the girl
would tire of waiting and come into the building.
He plucked up courage after a time to peer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>round the corner of the elevator. The car was
gone.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’ll she think of me?” he groaned.</p>

<p class='c009'>Wild schemes of revenge surged in him. Murder
with torture was among them. And always
while he cursed and planned his eyes were on the
staircase behind him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Came a time, however, when the elevator descended
empty, and the elderly man on the stool
inside prepared to read a newspaper. He was
startled by a husky whisper just beneath his left
ear.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Say, come here a minute, will you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>He turned. Through the grille beside him a
desperate face with one black eye was staring at
him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come here yourself,” he returned uneasily.</p>

<p class='c009'>With a wild rush the owner of the face catapulted
into the elevator and closed the grating.
Then he turned and faced him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Run me up, quick!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good God!” said the elevator man.</p>

<p class='c009'>There were steps in the entrance. With a frenzied
gesture Sergeant Gray, of the Headquarters
Troop of the ——th Division, gave a pull at the
lever. The car descended with a jerk.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Leggo that thing,” said the elevator man, now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>wildly terrified. “Want to shoot down into the
subway?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Thoroughly frenzied, Sergeant Gray pulled the
lever the other way. The car stopped, trembled,
ascended. For a moment two stenographers waiting
on the ground floor had a vision of a strange
figure in undershirt, cotton, one, and nether garments
to match, surmounted by a distorted face,
passing on its way to the upper floors.</p>

<p class='c009'>Sergeant Gray surrendered the lever, and ran
a trembling hand across his forehead.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ve got to hide me somewhere,” he shouted.
“Look at me!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I see you,” said the elevator man. “Y’ought
to be ashamed of yourself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ve got to hide me,” insisted Sergeant
Gray; “and then you’ve got to go out and buy
me some clothes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They had reached the top floor, and the car had
stopped.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll tell you later. You can get me a pair of
pants somewhere, can’t you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was pleading in his voice. Almost tears.
But the tears were of rage.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll lose my job if I leave this car,” observed
the elevator man. He had recovered from his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>fright, and besides he had recognised the boy’s
service hat.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Soldier, aren’t you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes. Look here, old man, I’m in a devil of a
mess. Lot of our fellows, met them outside—it’s
a joke. I’ll joke them!” he added vindictively.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Some fellows got a queer idea of humour,” observed
the elevator man. “I might send out for
you. Got any money?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The full depth of his helplessness struck Sergeant
Gray then and turned him cold. His money,
thirty-nine dollars and sixteen cents, was in
the slicker.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They took my money too.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The elevator man’s face grew not less interested
but more suspicious.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why don’t you get a good story while you’re
at it?” he demanded. “Looks like you’re running
away from something.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Great heavens, I should think I am!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You fellows,” observed the elevator man,
“think you can come to this town and raise hell
and then pull some soldier stuff and get out of it.
Well, you haven’t any effect on me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The buzzer in the cage had been ringing insistently.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>“I’ll have to go down. Crawl out, son.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Crawl out! Where to?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t know. Can’t let you in an office. You
may find some place.” He threw open the door.
“Out with you!” he commanded. “I’ll look you
up later.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Run me to the cellar,” gasped Sergeant Gray.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tailor’s shop there. Full of girls.”</p>

<p class='c009'>With a hoarse imprecation Sergeant Gray left
the elevator and scuttled down the hallway. To
his maddened ears the place was full of sounds,
of voices inside doorways and about to emerge, of
footsteps, of hideous laughter. He had wild visions
of finding a window and a roof, even of
jumping off it. Then—he saw on a door the
name of J. M. Booth, Photographer; and hope
leaped in his heart.</p>

<p class='c009'>He opened the door cautiously and peered within.
All was silent. On the table in the reception
room lay still open the album with which the girl
had amused herself while she waited, and over a
couch—oh, joy supreme!—there was flung an Indian
blanket. He caught it up and wrapped it
about him; and the madness left him. Such as it
was, he was clothed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Still cautiously, however, he advanced to the
studio. All was quiet there, but beyond he could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>hear water running, and the careful handling of
photographers’ plates. Mr. Booth, erstwhile of
Vienna, was within and busy. It irked the sergeant
profoundly that to such unworthy refuge
he was driven for shelter, but he squared his shoulders
and advanced. Then suddenly he heard footsteps
in the outer room, footsteps that advanced
deliberately and relentlessly.</p>

<p class='c009'>Wild fear shook him again. He looked round
him frantically, and then sought refuge. In a
corner behind a piece of scenery which was intended
to show the sitter in an Italian garden,
Sergeant Gray of the ——th Division sought
shameful sanctuary.</p>

<p class='c012'>Somewhat later in the day the general, having
a broiled squab and mushrooms under glass in a
window at the best restaurant in the city, put on
his glasses and looked out over the surging tide in
the brilliant sunlight of the street. Just opposite
him, moving sedately, was a group of soldiers.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wish you’d tell me,” said the general testily
to the aide-de-camp whose particular joy it was to
lunch with him, “what the deuce those fellows are
doing in slickers on a day like this.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No accounting for the vagaries of enlisted
men, sir,” returned the aide, ordering a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">demi-tasse</span></i>.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>IV</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c008'>At that exact moment the elevator man, having
a moment’s leisure after the lunch rush,
made his way back along the corridor where he
had left a wild-eyed refugee. All was quiet. In
the office of the National Asphalt Company the
clicking of typewriters showed that no fleeing soldier,
seeking sanctuary and a pair of trousers, had
upset the day’s pavements. Dolls and Wigs was
calm. Coat Fronts remained inadequate and still.</p>

<p class='c009'>He wandered back, his face twisted in a dry
grin. Then suddenly from Booth, Photographer,
he heard a wild yell. This was followed by the
crash of a heavy body, a number of smothered
oaths and a steady softish thud that sounded extremely
like the impact of fists on flesh.</p>

<p class='c009'>The elevator man opened the door of Booth,
Photographer’s, anteroom and stuck his head in.
The studio beyond showed something on the floor
that stirred in the wrapping of an Indian blanket,
while stepping across it and on it a mad thing in
undergarments and a service hat was delivering
blows at something unseen.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>The elevator man carefully reached a hand inside
the door and took out the key. Then as
stealthily he closed the door, locked it from the
outside, and moved back swiftly to his cage,
where the buzzer showed that the carpet cleaning
company which occupied the fourth floor was in a
hurry and didn’t care who knew it.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the end of twenty minutes two roundsmen
went up in the cage. Going up they learned of
the preliminaries.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Crazy, I guess,” finished the elevator man.
“He looked crazy, now I think about it. Probably
killed the lot by this time. Where do you
fellows hide, anyhow?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Back in Booth, Photographer, there was a complete
and awful silence. Revolvers ready, the
door was opened and the roundsmen sprang in.
It looked like the worst. The Indian blanket nor
moved nor quivered. A chair, overturned, lay on
top of it, and against that there leaned tipsily a
photographer’s screen, on which was painted, in
grays and whites, an Italian garden.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m glad to see you,” called a cheery voice.
“I’m glad to see you!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Standing in the doorway of the dressing room
was a tall young man. He held a brush in his
hand and was still slicking down his hair.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>“How are you, anyhow?” demanded the tall
young man, and proceeded to shake down the leg
of a pair of black trousers. “A trifle short, aren’t
they?” he observed. “But they’re a darn sight
better than nothing!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Get him, Joe,” said one of the officers casually,
and walked toward the inner room.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I’ll go along all right,” said Sergeant
Gray blithely. “It’s worth the price. I’m only
sorry you didn’t see it. I——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Joe!” called the other officer from the inner
room. “Come here, will you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mind if I go along?” asked Sergeant Gray.
“I’d like to look at ’em again. I want to remember
how they look all the rest of my life.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Joe nodded, and Sergeant Gray led the way to
the studio. In a corner, roped tightly to a chair,
sat Booth, Photographer. He was bleeding profusely
from a cut on the lip and another over the
eye, his head was bobbing weakly on his shoulders,
and he wore, to be exact, one union suit minus two
buttons on the chest and held together by a safety
pin.</p>

<p class='c009'>Joe stumbling over the Indian blanket heard
it groan beneath him, and uncovered a stout gentleman
in a cutaway coat and with his collar torn
off.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>“Pretty good, eh?” demanded Sergeant Gray.
“Sorry about the collar, though. Booth’s is too
small for me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Want an ambulance?” inquired the elevator
man with unholy joy in his eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes. Better have one.” And to the wreckage:
“You gentlemen will be all right,” said Joe.
“How’d this happen, anyhow?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll tell you,” volunteered the sergeant.
“They’re spies, that’s what they are. German
spies. D’you get it? And I——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Aw, shut up!” said the first roundsman, wearily.
“Take him along, Joe. Now, how d’you feel,
Mr. Booth?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I tell you——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You don’t tell me anything. You go. That’s
all.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, very well,” said Sergeant Gray cheerfully.
“You’ll be sorry. That’s all. Come on,
Joe.” He raised his voice in song.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where do we go from here, Joe, where do we
go from here?” he sang in a very deep bass.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the centre table he stopped, however, with
Joe’s revolver very close to him, and consulted
Mr. Booth’s watch which, with all of his money
but car fare back to camp, lay in a heap there.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You might hurry a bit, Joe,” he suggested
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>“I’ve only got twenty-three and a half hours’
leave, and time’s flying. You’ll observe,” he added,
“that old Booth’s money and watch are here.”
He glanced significantly toward the elevator man.
“Eight dollars and ninety cents, Joe,” he said.
“The old boy’ll need it for a doctor.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The general breakfasted rather late the next
morning—at seven o’clock. His ordinary hour
was six-thirty. He had eaten three fried eggs,
some fried potatoes, a bran muffin, drunk a cup
of coffee, and was trying to remember if he had
made any indiscreet remarks at a dinner party the
night before about Pershing or the General Staff,
when an aide came in with a report. The general
read it slowly, then looked up.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You mean to say,” he inquired, “that those
fellows haven’t had any clothes since yesterday
morning?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No uniforms, sir.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The entire troop?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All except those who were on duty here yesterday,
sir. I believe”—the aide hesitated—“I
believe some of them went to town anyhow, sir.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The devil you say!” roared the general.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I rather fancy that the men we saw in slickers,
sir——”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>Suddenly the general laughed. The aide
laughed also. Aides always laugh when the general
does. It is etiquette. When the general had
stopped laughing he became very military again,
and swore.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll look into it, Tommy,” he said. “It’s
a damned shame. Somebody’s going to pay for
it through the nose.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This is a little-used phrase, but the general had
read it somewhere and adopted it. It means
copiously.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was not aware, naturally, that Sergeant
Gray was already paying for it, copiously.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was at that precise moment that a little car
drew up outside his quarters. The general smiled
and rolled himself a cigarette.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bring me another cup of coffee,” he ordered,
“and get another chair, Tommy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The girl came in. She kissed the general on
his right cheek, and then on his chin, and then
stood back and looked at him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m in trouble, Uncle Jimmy,” she said. “If
a man from the Headquarters Troop overstays his
leave what happens to him?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Court-martialed; maybe shot,” replied the
general with a glance at Tommy, who did not see
it as he was looking at the girl.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>“But if it is my fault——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then you’ll be shot,” said the general cheerily.
“Now see here, Peggy, if you don’t let my young
men alone—— What’s that you’re carrying?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s a slicker!” said Peggy.</p>

<p class='c009'>The general looked at Tommy, and Tommy
looked back.</p>

<p class='c009'>Peggy told her story, and showed, toward the
end, an alarming disposition to cry.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He knew something,” she said. “That—that
man Booth was a spy, Uncle Jimmy. I could
hear him asking all sorts of questions, and when
the sergeant came out his face was——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sergeant, eh?” interrupted Uncle Jimmy.
“Any sergeants from the Headquarters Troop on
leave, Tommy?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll find out, sir.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Tommy went away.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I had got into the car, and he was coming,
when three or four other soldiers came along.
They all went back into the building, and I—I
thought they were going to get Mr. Booth. But
pretty soon they came out without him, and one of
them gave me this slicker; and—and they all
went away.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good Lord!” said the general suddenly. “The
young devils! The—the young scamps! So that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>was it. Now look here, Peggy,” he said, bending
forward with a twinkle. “I—well, I understand,
I can’t explain, but it was just mischief. Your
young man’s all right, though where he’s hiding——”</p>

<p class='c009'>He broke off and chuckled.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He is not at all the hiding sort.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Under certain circumstances, Peggy,” observed
the general, “any man will hide—and
should.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Some time later, at approximately the hour
when Sergeant Gray’s twenty-three and a half
hours’ leave was up, the little car started for the
city. It contained one anxious young lady, one
general who rolled constant cigarettes and
chuckled, and one aide on the folding seat in the
back, rather resentful because there was no adequate
place for his legs.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m going along, Tommy,” the general had
said. “It promises to be rather good, and I need
cheering. Besides, under the circumstances, a
member of Miss Peggy’s family——”</p>

<p class='c009'>At the building on Twenty-second Street the
general got out, leaving Peggy discreetly in the
car. He was a large and very military figure, and
he summoned the elevator man with a single commanding
gesture.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>“I want to know,” said the general fixing him
with a cold eye, “whether you happened, yesterday
afternoon, to have seen about here an enlisted
man without a uniform?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I did,” said the elevator man unctuously.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You did—what?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I did see him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Say, ‘sir’,” prompted the aide.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I did—sir.” It plainly hurt to say it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“When and where did you see him last?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“At one-thirty, getting into a police wagon—sir.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Exactly,” said the general. “You of course
provided him with clothing before the—er—arrest.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I did not,” said the elevator man, who had
by now decided that no man could bully him,
even if he did wear two stars. “He stole a suit.
And before he did that he like to killed two
men. Mr. Booth, he’s in the hospital now; and
as for the other gentleman, he was took away in
a taxi last night. If he was one of your men, all
I got to say is——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of no importance whatever,” finished the general
coldly. “Find out where he was taken,” he
added to Tommy, and stalked out. The elevator
man followed him with resentful eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>“You tell Pershing, or the Secretary of War,
or whatever that is,” he said venomously, “that
his pet wild cat is in the central police station. I
expect he’s in a padded cell. Good-by.”</p>

<p class='c009'>An hour later the little car stopped in front of
the best restaurant in town and the general assisted
his niece to get out. From the folding seat behind,
two pairs of long legs, one in khaki and
one in black rather too short, disentangled themselves
and followed. The best restaurants in
town in the morning present a dishabille appearance
of sweepers, waiters without coats and general
dreariness; but the general took the place by
storm.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Table for four,” he said. Now that he was
doing the thing he was minded to do it magnificently.
“Sit down, sergeant. Tommy, run and
telephone, as I told you, to the Department of
Justice. Got to nail those fellows quick.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As one newly awakened from sleep Sergeant
sat down beside Peggy. He presented, up to the
neck, the appearance of a Mr. Booth suddenly
elongated as to legs and arms. From the neck
up he was a young man who had found one
hundred and seventy-five dollars and the only girl
in the world.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>The general ordered breakfast for four. Then
he glanced up from the menu.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Suit you all right, Gray?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Splendidly, sir—unless——” He hesitated.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go ahead,” said the general. “You’ve earned
the right to choose what you like.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I was going to suggest, sir, that I ordinarily
have a bran muffin——”</p>

<p class='c009'>The general put down the menu and stared at
him. Then he chuckled.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Might have known it would be you!” he observed.
“But <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">c’est la guerre</span></i>, Gray. <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">C’est la
guerre!</span></i> We’ll have them.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>V</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c008'>Early that afternoon the stable sergeant of
the Headquarters Troop coming out of
divisional headquarters saw the general approaching
in a car much too small for him. Beside him
sat an aide, who drove wisely but not too well.
On the rumble seat were a girl, and a youth in
civilian clothes and a service hat. They were in
deep, absorbing conversation.</p>

<p class='c009'>The stable sergeant came stiffly to the salute,
and remained at it, the general giving no evidence
of seeing him and returning it. Then—the
stable sergeant went pale under his tan, for the
civilian emerging from the rear of the machine,
and strangely but sufficiently clad, was one Sergeant
Gray of the Headquarters Troop.</p>

<p class='c009'>As if this had not been enough he watched the
same Sergeant Gray assist to alight the young
lady of yesterday, and it gave no peace to the
stable sergeant’s turbulent soul to behold that
young lady giving the general a patronising pat
and then a kiss.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Great Scott!” said the stable sergeant feebly.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>But there was more to come, for Sergeant Gray
had spied his enemy and was minded to have
official confirmation of a certain fact. Before the
stable sergeant’s incredulous eyes he beheld Gray,
of the undergarments, gauze, et cetera, advance
to the general and salute, and then remark in a
very distinct tone:</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was very kind of you, sir, to ask me to
breakfast.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The general looked about under his gray eyebrows
and perceived a situation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not at all,” he replied in an equally distinct
voice. “Glad you liked my bran muffins.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The stable sergeant, who was carrying a saddle,
dropped it. Had he not been stooping he would
have observed something very like a wink on the
most military countenance in America. It was
directed at Tommy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good-by, Sergeant Gray,” said the pretty girl,
holding out her hand. “I—I think you are the
bravest person! And you will write, won’t you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wish I was as sure of my commission.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The stable sergeant swallowed hard.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you’ll get that now, of course. I’ll go
right in and tell Uncle Jimmy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I say!” protested Sergeant Gray. “You—you
mustn’t do that, you know.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>“Aw, rats!” muttered the stable sergeant; and
clutching the saddle furiously moved away. Up
the road he met a military policeman, and stopped
him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Better grab that fellow.” He indicated Sergeant
Gray behind him, now shamelessly holding
the hand of the general’s niece.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Awol,” replied the stable sergeant darkly—being
military brevity for absent without leave.
“And you might observe,” he added, “that he
isn’t in uniform.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The girl got into the little car. Hat in hand,
eyes full of many things he dared not put into
words, Sergeant Gray of the Headquarters Troop
of the ——th Division watched her start the
car, smile into his eyes and move away. He
came to at a touch on his arm.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’re you doing in that outfit?” demanded
the M. P. sharply.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Having an acute attack of heart trouble, if
you want to know,” said the sergeant, staring
after the little car.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Have to arrest you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, go to it!” said the sergeant blithely.
“I’m used to it now. Look here,” he added,
“your name’s not Joe, by any chance?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>“You know my name,” said the M. P. sourly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sorry,” reflected the sergeant. “Don’t mind
if I call you Joe, do you? Always like the men
who arrest me to be called Joe. It’s lucky.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He stopped and looked back; the little car
was almost out of sight.</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right, Joe, old top!” he said blithely. And
he sang in a deep bass</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<em>Where do we go from here, boys?</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>Where do we go from here?</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>All the way from Broadway to the Jersey City pier.</em>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>His voice died away. In his eyes there was
suddenly that curious blend of hope and sadness
which shines from the faces of those who love
and, loving, must go away to war.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wait a minute, Joe,” he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>And, turning, looked back again. The little
car was still in sight, and the girl, standing up
in it, waved her hand.</p>

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
